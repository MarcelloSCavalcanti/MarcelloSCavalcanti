### 📈 Currently learning

- Modern JavaScript patterns and better DOM handling  
- React fundamentals (components, props, hooks)  
- Accessibility and performance to make sites friendly for everyone

### 🤝 How I like to work

- Clear communication and fast feedback loops  
- Small, incremental improvements rather than big, risky changes  
- Always open to code reviews, suggestions and learning from more experienced developers  

If you have a project where a motivated junior front‑end developer can add value, I'd be happy to talk.
